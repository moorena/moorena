### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Pretty much all my work is done in private repos or secure/enterprise/corporate repos (under different accounts), not much to show here. 

This account is mostly used to access other repos.

Well, I mean, I wrote a sudoko solver and a wordle solver and some other silly things that are here, but private. That's a fun way to learn a new language and stretch your brain.
